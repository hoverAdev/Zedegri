The Zedegri Combat Engine is a combat simulator for a theoretical game, it is not meant to be perfect, it is meant to be functional
There is currently no intention of turning this specific repository into a video game, however if a team is created then that may change.

-Config.json-
contains:
speed_cap: the lowest the speed stat can exist before being blocked, the number CAN be lower, so be cautious.
level: the current level of the entire party upon booting the game.
environmental_damage: the percent of player HP removed upon the start of the characters turn. 10 = 10%
player_speed: The constant which is added to the current speed of each player.
max_ap: The maximum attainable ap, as low as 4 and as high as 7.

-Save_Data.txt-
contains:
currently unlocked humans, in narrative unlock order
currently unlocked zedegris, ordered by character linked with, and then by the order they are unlocked in.

-**Refer to the control guide on the controls, as they change depending on the room you are currently in.**-

-Known Issues and Crashes-
In Item Selection Screen:
  When in the Item Selection Bar, scrolling down to a spot which does not exist crashes the engine.
    Being on a spot which doesn't exist when changing to another character also crashes it. such as being on charm 18 and switching to a character with only 3 weapons, crash.
In Enemy Selection:
  Inputting the number of a combat Simulation which doesn't exist sends you to a boss which doesn't exist (doesn't crash)
In Combat:
  When defending the game may freeze, idk why i was playtesting and two teammates were dead and the game froze after the enemies attacked the last defending player, so i added F12 to reset all speeds to 0 and reset the pause.
